####**Where did God come from? v1.0**

The Creator God made the universe, the earth, and humans, right? But where did He come from? Where did the Creator God Himself come from? A lot of people stop short of a logical answer, but I would like to submit to you that there is a valid, logical answer to this.

Let me ask you, to start, a simple question.

What does the color blue smell like?

That doesn’t make sense. Color is a form of light, it doesn’t have a smell in and of itself. It’s not even the same thing, really.

Correct. This is called a category mistake. It’s when you ask a question that is unanswerable, not because we don’t know the answer, but because the question does not make sense - blue is not in the category of things that have smells.

We could ask what blue looks like, what wavelength it is, or even how it makes us feel; those are all valid questions. But the smell of blue is not a question that has an answer - the question itself is incorrect. It is a category mistake.

Let’s get back to the original question. Where did God come from?

You can reword it like this - when did God start? This is a time category question. The word “beginning” itself is a time-category statement: “when something started to exist”. Anything that has a beginning or is created inherently has a time that it started.

We’re very familiar with this idea. You can identify a beginning for everything in the universe. People have beginnings, things have beginnings, ideas have beginnings, places have beginnings. All began to exist in time at some point - they were not, and then they were for the first time.

But here’s the thing - in Genesis chapter one, we read that God created time. “In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth.” He created time, space, and matter.
OVERLAY ONTO VERSE: In the beginning (time) God created the heavens (space) and the earth (matter).

So if God initiated the concept of time, that means that our questions of what time did He start don’t make logical sense. He is outside of that category. At this point our ability to understand this ends; we do not have the capability to think without a time scale. But it still makes logical sense.

The idea of beginning is a time-category idea. But since the Creator God made time, it doesn’t make sense to ask when He began, just like it doesn’t make sense to ask what blue smells like.
